# Crypto_Tweet


## Currently the App fetches social data from Twitter using its Streaming API. LTC, BTC, ETH and XLM are the crypto currencies that are tracked in the application and due to the scaling issue, the app stores and reads the data from an excel sheet. A limit of 10000 tweets is enforced and after which the app is reset.
